# Project Title

## Overview
This project contains the implementation of baseline algorithms that were discussed in our recent research paper. These baseline methods are pivotal in assessing the performance of novel approaches developed during our study. The following sections describe each implemented baseline.

## Implemented Baselines

### 1. SeedExtension
**Description**: SeedExtension is a plagiarism detection algorithm that identifies overlapping text segments by extending seed matches between comparable documents.

Sidorov, "Adaptive algorithm for plagiarism detection: The best-performing approach at PAN 2014 text alignment competition," in 6th International Conference of the CLEF Association, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, vol. 9283, pp. 402–413, Springer, 2015.

### 2. Faerie
**Description**: Faerie is an efficient filtering algorithm designed for approximate dictionary-based entity extraction. This method focuses on optimizing the process of identifying entities from a large dataset.

### 3. BruteForce Method
**Description**: We also implement a straightforward BruteForce method that systematically enumerates all possible candidate matches between text segments to identify similarities. This method serves as a baseline to compare the efficiency and effectiveness of more sophisticated algorithms.
